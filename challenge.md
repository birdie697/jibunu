1.  Determine the lowest number of occurrences in an array.

    Example:  

    Given [1,2,3,4,1,2,3], solution is [4]


2.  Validate an array that is populated by a user response to answering a
    question where a user must select 3 out of 5 choices and rank the answers.

    Example:

    Given:  [1,2,3,4], solution is true.
            [1,3,5,2], solution is false because 4 is missing.
            [1,2,2,3,4] solution is false because 2 is listed twice.
